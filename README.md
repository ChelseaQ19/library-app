# Library Management System 

## Description

This library Management System allows you to manage books and their corresponding locations within a library. 

## Features 

- Add new books to the library
- List all books
- Update or delete existing books
- Manage book locations
- Count books by genre
- Find books in specific locations
- Save and load data in JSON format

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin
- JSON for storing data
- Gradle and Maven for dependencies

## Project Development Journey

## 1. Initial Setup

- Added skeleton code for the menu
- Added raw strings for the menu
- Added string template to the menu
- Created a UserInput folder within the utils package

**Explanation:**
- I began with implementing the basic skeleton code based on the database of my application, which was a many-to-many database structure. I added some raw strings and began with some simple user input for it too.

---

## 2. Adding Core Models and API files
- Added properties to classes
- Created more API files (BookAPI, LocationAPI, BookLocationAPI)
- Implemented models with corresponding collections

**Explanation:**
- Next, I built models representing key components of the system, such as Books and Locations. I then added corresponding APIs to handle the book management logic like adding, listing and deleting.

---

## 3. Implementing Core Features
- Implemented add and list methods for each model
- Added archive and active testing functionality
- Implemented a find method in BookLocationController

**Explanation:**
-  I created core features like adding books, listing books, adding locations and listing locations. When these were tested using JUnit testing, I then went to make similar methods and merge those methods into BookLocationController. I then again tested these methods using JUnit.

---

## 4. Lambdas and Persistance with JSON and XML
- Implemented JSON and XML serializers
- Created Lambdas expressions for the BookAPI submenu methods, such as counting the genres and listing the title names corresponding to what the user searches for.

---

## 5. Code Documentation and Automation
- Implemented KDoc comments
- Updated GitHub Actions with test reports

**Explanation:**
- I added KDoc to document the project and integrated GitHub Actions for automated testing and build reports. This helped me to maintain continuous integration for my application.

---

## 6. Final Refinements 
- Code Cleanup
- Fixed bugs from testing phases
- Updated README  and GitHub Pages

**Explanation:**
- I refined the project by fixing bugs, enhancing features, and updating documentation through GitHub pages, Wiki and a README file. This made the project more accessible and well-documented.
